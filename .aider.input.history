+```
+Title: Exit Strategy Planner
+
+Description:
+Create a simple app that helps users plan their exit strategy for any token. The app should work fully offline and must not use the internet or external APIs. All information is entered manually by the user.
+
+Functionality:
+ • Display three input fields:
+ 1. “Token Name”
+ 2. “Target Price”
+ 3. “Notes” (optional comments about the exit plan)
+ • Add a button labeled “Add Strategy” that adds the entry to a visible list.
+ • Below the inputs, show a section titled “Your Exit Strategies”, displaying all added items.
+ • Each item should show:
+ • Token Name
+ • Target Price
+ • Notes (if provided)
+ • Each strategy should have a “Delete” button allowing the user to remove that specific entry.
+ • Include a “Clear All” button to delete all stored strategies at once.
+ • If Token Name or Target Price is empty, show an error message:
+“Please fill in both Token Name and Target Price.”
+
+UI Requirements:
+ • Use only simple UI elements: text fields, labels, buttons, and a list display.
+ • Layout should be clean, minimal, and user-friendly.
+ • All interactions must update instantly and locally within the app.
+ • No external libraries or advanced elements.
+```
+
+Generate an app logo and update the app metadata title and description.
